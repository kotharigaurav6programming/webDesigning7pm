JavaScript
----------
1. JavaScript was developed by Brenden Eich in 1995.

2. JavaScript was mainly came to overcome the limitation of VBScript.

   Limitations of VBScript : 
   i. Browser specific -- Internet Explorer
   ii. Operating System specific -- Windows OS

3. JavaScript was initially known as LiveScript, but Java programming       
   language is very popular at that time, so Brenden Eich simply for gaining popularity put its script name from LiveScript to JavaScript.

    Note : JavaScript and Java are two different things because JavaScript is a scripting language whereas Java is a programming language.

4. JavaScript is a client side as well as server side scripting language.
   
   Client Side --> Front End --> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ReactJS etc
   |-- Mainly used for the purpose of Validation and events.

   Server Side --> Back End  --> Node, Express etc
   |-- Mainly for implementing core concepts.

5. JavaScript is mainly used to make website more interactive and attractive.

6. In other words, JavaScript is a prototype based object oriented,       
   imperative, loosely typed, interpreted scripting language.

   Prototype : Module | Function

   Object Oriented : Real world deal + oops concepts
   
   Prototype Based : Here we called it as a prototype based because the creation of object is based on function or in other words, objects are created by functions

   Imperative : What ever instructions you are giving, it works on that concepts only, whether you are giving correct instructions or not.

   For example, if i want to add two numbers, but i simply gives 5-2 then it will give 3 as a result instead of 7.

   Loosely typed : c/c++ = strictly typed
                   int a = 100;    char ch = 'a';   float f = 78.3f;
                   a = 100;         Invalid
                   ch = 'a';        Invalid   
                   f = 78.3f;       Invalid

                   JavaScript = loosely typed
                   a = 67;   b = 'x';   f = 45.45;
                   Here we have var,let and const keywords to set variable as it have some specific scope.

                   let a = 67;   var b = 'x';    const f = 3.14; 

7. JavaScript is used to make dhtml, here dhtml means Dynamic HTML.

8. JavaScript cannot run on its own, Browser is responsible to run javascript 
   code. Every browser have javascript engine to execute javascript code.
   |-- Google chrome = V8 engine
   |-- Mozila Firefox = Spider Monkey
   |-- Internet Explorer = Chakra

9. ECMA(European Computer Manufacturer Association) International created 
   ECMA Script to standerized JavaScript. 
   ECMA Script like ES5,ES6,ES7 etc 

10. JavaScript cannot deal with Html tags directly.Browser creates a DOM structure where Html Tags are considered as nodes(object) and with that JavaScript may interact with HTML tags.

11. There is Built-In object called as document. Which wraps the entire HTML Document. Here document is the object of HTMLDocument(Function | Prototype).
document comes under DOM(Document Object Model)

There is another Built-In object called as window. Which deals with entire browser. Here window is the object of Window(Function | Prototype).
window comes under BOM(Browser Object Model)

12. Here we write scripting inside <script> tag.
<script>
   ....
   ....
</script>
We can also create internal script and external script.
