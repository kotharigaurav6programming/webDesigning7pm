Promise

1. Promise simply reduces the complexity of callback hell
2. Promise itself use inbuilt callback
3. Promise is built in object.
4. We can create custom promise object
5. Promise have 3 state:
    a. pending
    b. fullfilled
    c. rejected
6. Inbuilt callbacks of Promise are : 
    resolve and reject 
7. Promise object contains resolve with a value or reject with a    
   reason
8. We deals with two methods :
    a. then : handles resolve value
    b. catch : handles reject reason  

9. Here then and catch also returns promise object with resolve value  
10. syntax : 

    new Promise(executor);

    where executor is callback, which consists of two inbuilt callback (resolve and reject) as an arguments.

    new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        // return resolve();
        // return reject();
    });
