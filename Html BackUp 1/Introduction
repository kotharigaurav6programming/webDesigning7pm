Web designing ----> web technologies ------> 1. Html

HTML :

    1. Full form of HTML is Hyper text markup language.
       Hypertext means a text which contains link to another text.
       Markup language : It means tag<> based language
       |-- It works on three terminology
                            |-- a. Definition
                            |-- b. Processing
                            |-- c. Presentation

    2. Html document contains multimedia content.
    3. We need to save html document by .html or .htm extension
    4. Output of html document is going to be displayed out on browser screen.
    5. Html also works on three terminology : 
        |-- Tag
        |-- Attribute
        |-- Element

    Tag : 
        Tags are hidden keywords, which are mainly used to display content on output screen.
        Tags can be classified as : 

            a. Empty Tag
               |-- only opening and no closing
               |-- <br>, <hr>, <img> etc
               |-- also known as unbalanced tag 
            
            b. Container Tag
                |-- having opening and closing both
                |-- <html></html>, <body></body> etc
                |-- also known as balanced tag

            c. Semantic Tag
                |-- Tags which shows there meaning or functionality to display content on screen by there name.
                |-- <header></header> , <footer></footer> etc

            d. Non-Semantic Tag or Structural Tag : 
                |-- Doesnot show there meaning by name, they are in generalized manner.
                |-- <form></form>, <div></div> etc

            e. Self Closing Tag
                |-- mainly used in React
                |-- <br/> , <hr/> etc

    Attribute :
        Attribute provides some additional information.
        <p>..........</p>
        <p align='center'>..........</p>
        <img src='' height='' width=''>

        here align, src, height, width are attributes
